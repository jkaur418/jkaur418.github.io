            <h2>Hi, my name is <span style="color: red;">Japneet Kaur Atwal</span></h2>
            <p>I am a a grade 10 student in Khalsa Secondary School. I am currently working on getting my BC highschool diploma. I am interested in law and plan on pursuing a law degree in university. I want to go to SFU after graduating high school and get a degree in criminology. I love to play volleyball, read nonfiction books about history, colouring, watching movies, and spending time with my family. My favourite colour is pink and I have a dog named Tiger that is only a few weeks old. I love to eat pizza, drink milkshakes, and try different foods. I have 3 members in my house, including me. I live with my mom and dad. I want to visit New York City and live there when I get older. I love Summer, beaches, sunsets, and my favourite flowers are hibiscus and lilies.</p>
